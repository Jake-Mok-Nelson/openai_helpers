# SwarmAgentCLI

## Overview

SwarmAgentCLI is a command-line interface tool designed to create, manage, and orchestrate swarm agents efficiently. It provides a suite of functionalities to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and interaction of swarm-based applications.

## Functionalities

- **Agent Creation**: Create agents with specific goals to automate various tasks.
- **Swarm Design**: Design swarms containing multiple agents with cooperative objectives.
- **Prompt Generation**: Generate or improve prompts for tasks effectively.
- **Output Saving**: Save generated content or agent designs to files for future use.
- **Exit Functionality**: Exit the CLI when operations are complete.

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a compatible environment that supports the CLI.
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces.

### Installation

You can clone the repository or download the source code. Install required dependencies using:

```bash

### Basic Interaction

SwarmAgentCLI is an interactive tool. Here are ways to interact with it:

- **Creating an Agent**: Simply describe the goal of the agent you wish to create - for example, "Manage emails and notify me of important ones."
  
- **Designing a New Swarm**: Provide a goal for the swarm you want to design, like "Create a collaborative swarm of agents for data analysis."

- **Generating or Improving a Prompt**: State the task for which you need a prompt refined or generated.

- **Saving Output**: At any point, you can choose to save the data generated during your interaction, specifying a filename.

## Examples

### Creating an Email Management Agent

When prompted, you might say: 
"Create an agent that manages emails and notifies me of important ones."

### Designing a Data Analysis Swarm

For swarm design:
"Please design a swarm of agents that collaborates on data analysis tasks."

### Improving a Work Task Prompt

To improve a prompt, you could input:
"Help me refine the email management strategy for better user engagement."
